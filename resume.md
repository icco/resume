## Background

I am a software developer with an interest in communication and design. I enjoy experimenting with new things to expand my knowledge and I believe that creating ways for people to share knowledge is one of the greatest goals for mankind. 

I strive to be a quick learner and both a competent leader and capable worker. I am an Eagle Scout and was an active officer of the Cal Poly Linux Users Group for three years. I was awarded Cal Poly's Residence Hall Council member of the year for both 2006 and 2007. In my free time I enjoy contributing to open source projects, hiking, reading and listening to music.

Fall 2006 - Spring 2011

## Proficiency

I have been writing code, running servers and experimenting with new software since 2002. Most recently the majority of code I have written has been in Java, Ruby, Javascript and Bash, but I have experience in C, Python, SML/NJ, C++, SQL and F#.
