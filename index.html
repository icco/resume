      <p class="lh-copy mb0">Based in Beacon, NY, I am a Software Developer and have been writing software for the web professionally since 2005. I have two passions in software. The first is building beautiful tools for people to share knowledge, advice and experience. Second is creating reliable infrastructure that is easy to use and maintain.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Outside of the tech-world I am an Eagle Scout. I enjoy contributing to open source projects, writing, reading, fishing, listening to music and wandering through cities and countrysides. I maintain a personal website at <a href="https://natwelch.com">natwelch.com</a>.</p>
